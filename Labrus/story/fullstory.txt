Let's start from the beginning!
You are a doctor. 
Due to your questionable background it is hard to find a job.
You have just arrived at your new workplace.
You would work anywhere else, but you were desperate.
You are nervous.
You open the door.
...
There is an old lady by the desk in the back.
She is carrying... something furry.
As you take a step in she jumps up startled.
Crazy Lady: "You must be... Oh yes it is you must be you MUST HELP!!!!123!"
She throws the thing at you and you catch it.
It is the weirdest creature you've ever seen.
Crazy Lady: "Take care of this Baby Naked Furry Bellybutton Pet for me, will ya?"
You stare at the thing.
Crazy Lady: "Yewsyesyewsyehh..."
The lady storms outside.
You stare after her for a while.
There is really nothing you can do about it.
But oh Look! The baby --whateveritwas-- is pulling your sleeve!!
...
Well? What are you waiting for??
You should probably name it...
