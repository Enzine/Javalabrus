Peaceful and relaxed.
Looking at you in state of sleepy content.
Wagging its tale at your feet.
Making kind growling noices.
Waddling around you.
Wondering who you are...
Jumping up and down amazed by you!
Staring... at you.
It looks weird. Could be a smile.
Yawning.
Utterly fascinated by your fingers... 
Observing the environment, sniffing around.
